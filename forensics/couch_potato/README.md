SSTV Scottie 1 encoded image of flag

## Solve

- I like to use the linux application qsstv https://github.com/ON4QZ/QSSTV to solve it.  It is a gui application, just open up the wav file in the application and hit decode.  It should automatically ID the encoding and produce the image.
- Other applications may be more difficult or have strange audio file types, not that they are not also capable of decoding the scottie encoding, but qsstv works well.
