# zkwarmup

Simple implementation of zero-knowledge proof for quadratic residues.
Vulnerability is usage of predictable time-based random seed.

To solve, predict the coin flips and cheat the proof with specially chosen values.

If b = 1, pick any $z$ and let $s = z^2$.

If b = 0, pick any $s = y^c$ where $c$ is an odd number. Then $z^2 = y^c(y) = y^{(c + 1)}$, and $z = y^{(c + 1)/2}$, which is easily computable because $(c + 1)$ is even.

Note, it was NOT intended for x to be generated by the predictable RNG:
```
    random.seed(int(time.time()))
    x = random.randrange(1, n)
    y = pow(x, 2, n)
```

Can't believe I missed that ðŸ¤¦
