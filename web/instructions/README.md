Wasm + experimental Compute Pressure API

> Instructions unclear. Flag stuck in ceiling fan.

## Solve

1. Decompile WASM and see references to Compute Pressure API https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/compute-pressure
2. Use 100% of your CPU to trigger it. (by compiling Rust, for example)
